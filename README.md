## Information Engineering (Level 6 - 3rd year UG) (University of Suffolk)

Welcome to your third year and the Information Engineering module! In this semester, we will get to know information systems and information engineering more closely.

Industry, commerce and research are being transformed by the potential to capture, store, manipulate, analyse and visualise data and information on a massive scale. Data-driven discovery and prediction are yielding new insights to businesses and academe in every domain, while information retrieval in the form of web search engines are the default mechanism by which most individuals prefer to find information.

<strong> Information Engineering </strong> is the engineering discipline that deals with the generation, distribution, analysis, and use of information, data, and knowledge in systems.

The components of information engineering include more theoretical fields such as <strong> machine learning, artificial intelligence and information theory</strong>, and more applied fields such as <strong> computer vision, natural language processing, bioinformatics, medical image computing,</strong> and <strong>robotics</strong>. Many of these originate from computer science, as well as other branches of engineering such as computer engineering, electrical engineering, and bioengineering.

"Big Data" in all its varied forms requires a set of statistical, analytical and programming skills, which are currently in short supply, and likely to remain so for the foreseeable future as this remains a bleeding edge growth area in terms of career opportunities. This module aims to provide students with the core skill set for information engineering, drawing across data science, artificial intelligence, operational research, information retrieval, and related technologies.

Join me in this module this semester where we will learn the basic principles and practice of information, information systems and develop the skills to generate, maintain and extract insights from data. Topics we will cover will include:

History and context of data science and information engineering
Technology landscape
Parallel databases and query processing, and in-database analytics
MapReduce and Hadoop
Key-value stores and NoSQL, examples of NoSQL implementations
Programming using Python and R
Topics in information retrieval
Topics in statistical modelling: statistics review, concepts, design, pitfalls
Topics in machine learning: supervised learning, optimisation, unsupervised learning, classification, mining, forecasting
Topics in reasoning with uncertainty
Topics in visualisation and graph analytics
Issues in privacy and ethics
Learning Aims
By the end of this module, you should be able to:

To develop knowledge and understanding of the statistical, algorithmic, and analytical concepts and methods which underpin and embody the core of data science and information engineering
To develop the skills and intuitions necessary to select and design an information engineering solution to practical data and information problems
To develop skills to successfully apply statistical, algorithmic, and analytical techniques to implement an information engineering solution using appropriate programming languages and software packages and draw rational conclusions based on the results of the solution
Learning Outcomes
By the end of this module, you will be able to:

Demonstrate a systematic understanding and knowledge of the statistical, algorithmic and analytical concepts and methods which form the core of data science and information engineering
Identify the most appropriate techniques and tools for a particular data or information problem, and be critically aware of the limitations on these methods
Design an information engineering solution to a particular data or information problem from a toolbox of appropriate techniques
Implement an information engineering solution, including such aspects as data modelling at scale, statistical modelling, programming and visualisation of results
Draw relevant and rational conclusions from the application of an information engineering solution to a particular data or information problem, and critically appreciate the uncertainties and limitations to the accuracy and/or applicability of these results

### About this module

The on-demand delivery of compute, database, storage, applications and IT resources through cloud computing has enabled many organisations to deliver innovative solutions without upfront capital investment. Cloud computing ecosystems provide a variety of scalable AI and machine learning solutions. This module provides a comprehensive grounding in cloud computing concepts and solutions, buttressed with extensive practicals to build experience in individual services and architectural designs. As the University of Suffolk is an AWS Academy partner institution, the module will give you an opportunity to acquire AWS certification(s) if you so wish. 

The aims of the module are: 

 * to introduce the concept of cloud computing as it applies to Data Science and Artificial intelligence, its advantages and limitations, economics, services and architectures
 * to introduce cloud computing architecture concepts such as client, application, server, Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Data as a service (DaaS)
 * to introduce different types of cloud computing services deployment (Public Cloud, Private Cloud, Hybrid Cloud, Community Cloud)
 * to introduce issues around cloud computing security and privacy, replication, reliability; 
 * to introduce different cloud business models and applications for Data Science and AI (Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud);
 * to provide hands on practice with actual commercial cloud services - students will be able to design a cloud solution using commercial cloud services

### Learning Outcomes

On successful completion of this module, a student will be able to:

1. Evaluate the technical dimensions of AI and data science architectures and solutions with specific emphasis on cloud approaches
2. Combine theory, research and practice at forefront of the discipline and use it to guide the development of robust and high quality cloud solutions and architectures
3. Critically review cloud solutions and tools for AI and data science problems
4. Demonstrate system-level competencies in assessing, understanding, creating and improving cloud-based architectural solutions
